My name's Harry Potter and I'm really great now,
I don't have to walk as I can apparate! Now
I'm a good learner and I learn real good
Ever since I learned how to apparate, I feel good
I feel on top of the world!
Metaphorically!
Well I could go there if I wanted to, but I don't.
So just leave me alone, ok.

Now you see me, now you don't.
Come on, order me to sit still,
cause I won't sit still, I'm a smooth apparator.
Check my magic, don't be a hater!

(Instrumental)

Harry Potter in France! Sacre bleu!
Harry Potter in Japan! So kawaii!
Something on the top shelf! Who can reach?
Harry Potter probably can! I'm your guy!

Harry Potter on a farm! Yeah why not?
Harry Potter in space! Feelin' great!
Cause there ain't no place Harry Potter can't grace
When I A-a-a-a-a-a-a-apparate!

Harry Potter to the left!
Harry Potter to the right!
Harry Potter out of sight!
Make you want to apparate all night!
