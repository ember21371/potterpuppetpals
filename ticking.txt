What is that mysterious ticking noise?
Not over here, not over there,
Kind of catchy.

Snape, Snape, Severus Snape.

Dumbledore!

Ron, Ron, Ron Weasley!

Hermione. Hermione. Hermione, Hermione, Hermione.

Harry Potter, I'm Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter, Harry Harry Potter!

Singing our song, all day long, at Hogwarts!

I've found the source of the ticking! It's a pipe bomb!

YAY!!!!!

(pipe bomb explodes)

Voldemort, Voldemort, ooh, Volde, volde, volde Voldemort!
